### Background Information:

Netflix offers customers the flexibility to pay for their monthly subscription through a partner like Comcast or TMobile. Partners integrate with the Netflix Subscription platform through an API layer.


### Problem Statement:

Partners are able to retrieve the list of customer charges for the next billing cycle on a daily basis. The amount to be charged and the currency are also be specified.


### Objective:

Implement the component that would retrieve the list of charges and respond with either an “Approval” or “Decline” of those charges. Define the API to retrieve the charges from and an API to accept the charge processing results. For the purposes of this exercise, the API returning these values may store sample charges in a simple data store of your choice, examples include a JSON, XML, or CSV, file, etc.
